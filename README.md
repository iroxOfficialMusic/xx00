# xx00
xx00 is a custom programming language made by irox. It's simple, similar to C#... I think, lel, anyways...
To run it you need a compiler, WHICH I will post soon (it isn't open source, sowwy :3 [maybe i will make it in the future])

This is just a project I made for fun, nothing serious.
This does not have any possible ways of causing damage to a machine, or a OS.

# How to use:
1. Create a (or download a existing) .xx00 file
2. Drag and drop it to the compiler


# Tutorial
Soon, don't worry ;)

# Requirements
NET 9.0
